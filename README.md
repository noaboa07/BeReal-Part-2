# Project 3 - *BeReal PT.2*

Submitted by: **Noah Russell** ZNumber: **Z23667779**

**BeReal PT.2** is the second phase of the project that enhances the initial app by adding persistence and engaging features. Users can upload unique photos from their photo albums, allowing for personalized sharing. A key functionality ensures that users cannot see friends' photos until they’ve posted their own, encouraging active participation. The app fetches the 10 most recent photos from the server within the last 24 hours, only displaying posts made within that timeframe relative to the user's last upload. To maintain excitement, photos that fall outside this window are obscured with a blur effect. Additionally, each post includes a comment section where users can interact, showcasing the commenter's username and context. Posts are also tagged with a timestamp and location, enriching the shared experience and fostering community engagement. This update captures the spontaneity and authenticity that define the BeReal experience (still some things to be added).

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total
