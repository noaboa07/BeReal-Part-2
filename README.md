# BeReal PT.2 - Enhanced Social Photo Sharing App

**BeReal PT.2** builds upon the foundation laid in **BeReal Clone PT 1** by adding several engaging features to improve the user experience. In this phase, users can upload personalized photos from their photo albums and share them with friends. The app introduces a time-sensitive feed that encourages active participation‚Äîusers are unable to see others' posts until they have uploaded their own photo within a 24-hour window. Additionally, posts are enriched with timestamps, locations, and comment sections for better interaction, allowing users to engage with each other's posts meaningfully. The app also features blurred photo previews for posts outside the 24-hour timeframe, maintaining the spontaneity that defines the BeReal experience.

## Development Process

This app was developed using UIKit to provide a clean and responsive interface. The focus was on improving user engagement by ensuring that posts are timely and interactive. Back4App was used to manage user data, posts, and comments. The time-sensitive feed adds an element of urgency to the app, while the location and timestamp features enrich the user experience.

## Challenges Faced

- **Comment Section Implementation:** Implementing the comment section proved to be a challenging task due to difficulties in managing the backend interaction for posting and fetching comments in real-time.
- **24-Hour Feed Logic:** Managing the logic to ensure only posts within a 24-hour window are displayed correctly, with older posts being blurred, required careful handling of timestamps.

## Key Takeaways
- Gained experience with time-sensitive feeds and working with location-based data.
- Improved skills in integrating backend services with real-time features such as comment sections.
- Learned how to manage user data and posts more effectively in a social app environment.

## Technologies Used
